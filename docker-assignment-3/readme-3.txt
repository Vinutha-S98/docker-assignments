# Assignment 3: Docker Compose - Nginx + BusyBox Writer

This assignment demonstrates a multi-container Docker Compose setup where an Nginx server serves HTML updated every 5 seconds by a BusyBox writer container.

## ‚úÖ Setup Overview

- **Nginx**: Serves content from `/usr/share/nginx/html` on port 8080.
- **BusyBox**: Writes an updated HTML file every 5 seconds to a shared volume.
- **Volume**: `shared-html` is mounted to both containers.
- **Network**: `shared-net` allows inter-container communication.
